# An Orginizational Chart built with html, css and jquery for connecting lines

* No images are used so it was flat when flat wasn't cool :-)

## About

This was written in 2006 but supprisingly, it still works.

## Tested in the following browsers in 2014

* Chrome Version 34.0.1847.116
* FireFox Version 28.0
* Safari Version 7.0.3 (9537.75.14)

## When originally written in 12/29/06 it worked on

* IE 6,7,Firefox and Sefari

## Files included

* jquery.js Version 1.2.1 (Told you it was old)
* jquery.dimensions.js Version 1.1.2
* jquery.orgchart.js Version 0.0.1
* org-skin.css As the name implys it handles making it purdy
* org.css Handles putting things in the correct place
* index.html An example/test file with a gack load of names and nested relationships.

## Written mostly for accessability

* It uses ol and li for layout the css and javascript are just to make it purdy for sighted folks.

## Other things

* hCard Microformat for individuals
* I think it will handle as many names and nested relationships you can throw at it. Tested with 8000 or so names and 7 levels of relationships.
* I don't recomend you use as many as tested. It takes a goodly long time to render.
